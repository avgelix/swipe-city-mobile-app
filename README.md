# Where to Move Game

## 📖 Project Overview
**What we're building:** A fun, interactive web game that helps you figure out where in the world you should live.

**Why it matters:** Choosing where to move is overwhelming—there are thousands of cities across hundreds of countries. How do you know which place matches your lifestyle? This game makes it simple: just swipe through cards answering questions about your preferences (like work style, food, hobbies, and budget), and we'll match you with a city that fits you best.

**How it works:** Think "Tinder meets Zillow"—swipe through questions, get matched with your ideal city, then dive deeper to find the perfect neighborhood. It's like having a friendly real estate agent guide you through finding your dream location, but way more fun.
